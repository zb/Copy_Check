Small utility to check validity of.. anything written. Explodes text of any size(default is sentences of 10 words or more) before referencing Bing for originality. 

It pushes sentences over the limit (default of 22 seems to be near the search algorithm's boundary) to the end of the stack, so while it may not be pretty the longer fragments should still be represented.

You need a Bing API key to make this work.
